# Gender Classification Project ðŸŽ¯

This project uses Transfer Learning with a pre-trained ResNet18 model to classify images into Male or Female based on facial features.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
The gender classification model uses ResNet18 as its backbone. The architecture is modified as follows:

Backbone:

ResNet18 pre-trained on ImageNet

Custom Classification Head:

Original fully connected layer (fc) replaced with:

Linear layer (512 â†’ 512 units)

ReLU activation

Dropout (e.g. probability 0.3) to reduce overfitting

Linear layer (512 â†’ 2 units) for binary classification (male / female)

This design enables the network to learn high-level facial features while adapting specifically to gender prediction.


 # ðŸš€ Project Overview--
