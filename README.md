Gender Classification Project ðŸŽ¯
This project uses Transfer Learning with a pre-trained ResNet18 model to classify images into Male or Female based on facial features.
ðŸš€ Project Overview--
1.Model: ResNet18 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
2.Framework: PyTorch
3.Task: Gender Classification from facial images
ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries--
1.Python
2.PyTorch
3.TorchVision
4.Google Colab
ðŸ“Š Achievements--
1.Validation Accuracy: ~91%
2.Successfully able to predict gender from unseen images.
âš  Limitations--
1.Model trained only on frontal face images.
2.May misclassify images with extreme lighting, blur, occlusion, or multiple faces.
